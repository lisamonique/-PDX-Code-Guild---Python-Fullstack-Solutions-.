                <p>Think of cheeseburgers like a Tinder match. They might not all be your soulmate but you’ve gotta find out to be sure. It can get a little messy and that’s just part of the fun.</p>
                <p>Some are cheesy, others can be a little dry, and the rare few are a disaster. There are so many cheeseburgers out there it can be hard to commit to just one favourite. That being said, when you know, you just know.</p>
                <p>Everyone has their perfect match. Sometimes it’s just around the corner, other times you have to travel the world in search of it. Wherever your perfect cheeseburger is, it’s out there.</p>

                <h2>Wine, Wine, & More Wine</h2>
                <p>The Bordeaux wine region accounts for more than sixty percent of the cabernet sauvignon grown in France. An inimitable flavor is found in barrels. Overripe grapes can make the wine taste burnt. Oak imparts vanilla, toast, caramel and coffee. Fruity flavors, with aromas of rose petals, peaches, and allspice. Sangiovese – go ahead, pronounce it.</p>
                <p>Wine and a sonnet to ponder. White is good with fish. If a husband found his wife drinking wine in the early Roman times, he was at liberty to kill her. In order to increase the alcohol content of their wines, some vintners began adding sugar to the grape must in a process called chaptalization. Winemakers refer to screw caps as Stelvin enclosures, because it sounds better than "lid."</p>
                <p> Pinot Grigio and Pinot Gris are two names for the same wine. Grapes crushed and ready for fermentation are called must.</p>
                <p> Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians. Wine is often served with dinner. Quip intelligently over oak-aged Chablis.</p>
                <p> Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects. More? Hint: Sangiovese is a four syllable word. Maybe more if you're drunk.</p>
