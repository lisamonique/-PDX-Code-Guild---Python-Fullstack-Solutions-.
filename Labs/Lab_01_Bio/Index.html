            <q> I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal. <br> People know me. I'm very important. <br> I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany.</q>
            <p>Ron Burgundy first attended Harvard Junior College in Waco, Texas, earning his Associate's Degree. After failing to get into San Diego State University and the University of Southern California, he attended the University of San Diego (USD). As a Torero, Ron Burgundy competed with the USD Rowing Team (where he served as coxswain).He studied Communications Studies. However, he left without finishing his Bachelor's in order to take his first job in broadcast journalism with Channel 4, where he would eventually anchor. Ron Burgundy is cocking, domineering, and proud to a fault. He is very old-fashioned in his views about women, as he is bothered when his female coworker Veronica Corningstone is first hired.He isn't very smart, but he is well-loved by the city of San Diego, where he lives and works. He often believes he is right and is unwilling to say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong. His closest friend is his dog, Baxter. Ron is a keen flute player, specifically jazz flute where he performs an off the cuff routine to Veronica. He is incredibly proud of his apartment, claiming it has many leatherbound books and smells of rich mahogany.</p>
            <p>Ron Burgundy has old-fashioned views on women, a cocky sense of humor and very determined personality. He is comical to the point of making the news program an entertainment industry and not taking his job very seriously. Despite his good sense of friendship, his success sometimes gets the better of him and becomes arrogant as a result. His arrogance is such that he believes that he is entitled to make decisions for others, like in The Legend Continues. When he becomes blind, he becomes very pessimistic and he is convinced he cannot develop his other senses. He howls every morning because of his blindness and his lifestyle becomes terrible because of how he handles his lighthouse, like using fire in a dish washer and using the oven to put flowers inside. At the end, his loneliness pushes him to stop blaming others for his mistakes and he apologizes to his friends for his mistreatment towards them.</p>
